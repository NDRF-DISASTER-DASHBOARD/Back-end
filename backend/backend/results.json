      "snippet": "\n The 2024 Wayanad landslides were a series of landslides that occurred in Punjirimattom, Mundakkai, Chooralmala, and Vellarimala villages in Meppadi panchayat, Vythiri taluk[5] in Wayanad district, Kerala, India in the early hours of 30 July 2024. The landslides were caused by heavy rains that caused hillsides to collapse, destroying the areas below. The disaster was one of the deadliest in Kerala's history, with reports of over 336 fatalities,[6][7][8] 397 injuries,[9] and 78 people missing.[10][9] Deforestation, seismic sensitivity, poor building construction, and global warming have been identified as possible causes for the landslides and fatalities.\n Many government agencies such as the armed forces, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire and rescue services, and forest and wildlife authorities, as well as volunteers, launched a large-scale rescue mission to search for survivors.[11]\n",

      "snippet": "The Wayanad landslide of 2024, triggered by heavy monsoon rains and a midnight cloudburst on July 30th, brought unimaginable devastation to Kerala, South India. We lost over 415 lives, with more than 200 of our brothers and sisters still missing. The disaster reduced homes, resorts, schools, places of worship, and vital infrastructure to rubble, leaving survivors with nothing but the wet, torn clothes they wore as they fled for their lives. Wayanad, a district known for its hills, valleys, and tea gardens, is one of the most underdeveloped regions in Kerala. We, the friars living in the remote village of Meppadi, found ourselves deeply connected to this tragedy. Our friary, Prakruthi Mithra, which stands for living in harmony with nature, is located within the vicinity of the disaster. On that fateful night, the relentless rains turned the Chaliyar River into a violent torrent. The landslides not only caused physical destruction but also left deep psychological scars. What was once a life-giving monsoon became a terrifying force of death. As we looked around, we saw our neighbors, once eagerly awaiting the monsoon rains to bring relief from the summer heat, now facing a harsh reality. The landslides, combined with the fear of more to come, forced many into temporary camps. The pain of losing loved ones was unbearable, especially for those who couldn\u2019t even recover the bodies of their family members to perform last rites.",

The July 30 landslide resulted in a debris flow of nearly six million cubic metres -- capable of filling 2,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools  stretching eight kilometres downhill, the study found.  Previously, the 1998 Malpa landslide in Uttarakhand held the record for the largest debris flow in the country. The Wayanad landslide was five times larger than Malpa and 300 times the size of the 2020 Pettimudi landslide in Munnar.  The study conducted jointly by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Mohali, Kerala University, and the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies used LiDAR technology and photogrammetric methods to arrive at its conclusion.

Wayanad district received more than 140 mm of rainfall in the 24 hours between the mornings of Monday and Tuesday, about five times more than what is expected, data from India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed.
